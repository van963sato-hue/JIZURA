# JIZURA — Lyric Motion Video Maker

Turn lyrics into animated lyric videos in your browser. JIZURA combines layouts, entrances, holds, exits, decorations, text treatments, backgrounds, camera moves, effects and transitions. Change the seed or press **Create a variation** to explore another arrangement.

The English and Japanese browser editions share the same project format and saved browser data. Use the language links at the top of the editor to switch editions without changing your lyrics or settings. English After Effects panels are available as [ScriptUI](https://852wa.github.io/JIZURA/JIZURA_AE_en.jsx) and [CEP](https://852wa.github.io/JIZURA/JIZURA_CEP_en.zip) downloads. The AE JSON format is the same in both languages.

## Quick start

1. Paste lyrics into the left panel, one phrase per line. The built-in English sample is shown on a fresh install.
2. Optionally import audio. JIZURA detects beats and can snap cut boundaries to them. Use **Tap to sync** to mark the start of each line by pressing Space during playback.
3. Press **Create a variation** (or `R`) to randomize the style, mood, motion, palette and arrangement. **Previous** and **Next** navigate variations; **Change one thing** rerolls just one part.
4. Set aspect ratio, resolution and frame rate, then export MP4. Advanced mode adds a PNG sequence, transparent PNGs, color key backgrounds and individual technique controls.

**Lyrics language.** The styles are designed around Japanese fonts. For Chinese (Traditional / Simplified) and Korean lyrics, set **Lyrics language** below the lyrics box (Auto-detect is the default: kana → Japanese, Hangul → Korean, Chinese only → Traditional or Simplified by characters such as 們/们 and 說/说). Each font is then replaced with a face in that language with a similar feel — e.g. Noto Sans JP → Noto Sans TC / SC / KR, Noto Serif JP → Noto Serif TC / SC / KR, Dela Gothic One → WDXL Lubrifont TC / ZCOOL QingKe HuangYou / Black Han Sans — so a line never mixes fonts. The AE panels have the same setting, the AE JSON carries the language, and AE falls back to the OS fonts (PingFang, Microsoft JhengHei / YaHei, Apple SD Gothic Neo, Malgun Gothic) when those faces are not installed.

Lyric syntax: `I remember/the dawn` makes a manual cut; `*word*` emphasizes a word; a final `!` adds a flash and shake; `lyric|note` adds small annotation text; `[01:23.45]lyric` imports an LRC timestamp; `# comment` is ignored.

Use **Save** and **Open** for `.jizura.json` projects. **Export for AE** creates arrangement data to import into the After Effects panel. Generated videos and images belong to their creators; rights to music and lyrics remain with their respective rights holders. Project files, lyrics and audio are handled in the browser. Google Fonts are loaded as needed. The tool is MIT licensed; see [LICENSE](LICENSE) and [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).

## Add animated lyrics to an existing music video

1. Import a local video in **Add lyrics to an MV**. MP4, WebM and other formats work when the browser supports their codecs. The file stays in your browser.
2. Enter lyrics and edit each line's **Start / End (s)**. You can also import LRC timestamps or use **Tap to sync**. Manual edits override LRC timing; setting an earlier end leaves a gap for an instrumental passage.
3. Importing a new video automatically adopts its exact aspect ratio. To export another shape, change the aspect ratio in export settings and choose **Fit whole video** or **Fill frame**. Adjust the center / lower / upper text placement, scale, horizontal and vertical position, shadow and video dimming.
4. Select **Video audio**, **Imported audio** or **Mute**. Imported audio replaces the video's soundtrack. If the browser cannot extract the video audio, import a separate audio file or explicitly select Mute.
5. Export **MP4** or a **PNG sequence** to composite the footage and animated lyrics. The output uses the original video's duration. **Transparent PNG** exports only the lyric animation for compositing elsewhere. MP4 requires WebCodecs and a supported encoder; Chrome or Edge is recommended.

MV mode retains the text animation and palette while omitting opaque style backgrounds, HUD, global post-processing and transitions. Automatic title cards and interlude cuts are also disabled. Some existing layouts contain graphic bands or panels; choose a layout that leaves the important parts of your footage visible.

Saved project JSON includes lyrics, timing, MV settings and the source video's filename, but does not embed video or audio files. Re-select the same video and any separate audio when reopening a project. MV compositing is a browser-edition feature.

## Build and publish

Run `python3 build.py` at the repository root. It creates `index.html` and `en/index.html`, both standalone pages for GitHub Pages. Run `python3 build_ae.py --lang en` to rebuild `JIZURA_AE_en.jsx`, and `python3 build_cep.py --lang en --out dist` to build `dist/JIZURA_CEP_en.zip` (copy the ZIP to the repository root for Pages downloads). Commit the built pages, panels and translation sources together. Publish from the repository root on GitHub Pages; the English edition is then served at `/JIZURA/en/`. Open either HTML file locally for offline use, with installed fonts as a fallback.

Install `JIZURA_AE_en.jsx` in After Effects' `Scripts/ScriptUI Panels` folder, restart AE, then open it from the Window menu. The English CEP package has a distinct extension ID, so it can coexist with the Japanese CEP panel. Extract the ZIP and use its Windows or macOS installer. These panels require After Effects to verify motion and export behavior; automated checks use a mock AE environment.
